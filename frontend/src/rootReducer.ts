// When `combineReducers` is used,
// every action gets dispatched to every reducer.
// Since reducers don't change the state on unrecognized
// actions, this is okay. Further, each reducer believes
// it has its own top-level state, but in reality it is
// just passed a part of the whole state. E.g., if `combineReducers`
// is passed
//   {
//      mypath: myReducer
//   }
// When `myReducer(localState)` is called, `localState == globalState.mypath`.
